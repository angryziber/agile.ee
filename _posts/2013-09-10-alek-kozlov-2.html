<h2>Enterprise Agility &ndash; do you really want this pain? ...Why?<a href="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Alek_220.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-614" title="Alek_220" src="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Alek_220.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="220" /></a></h2><br />
Common sense is not so common &ndash; last year I have noticed that agile methodology is becoming a mainstream. Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Cisco, or any other &ndash; just name it. All are saying that to be agile is important. Can you point at any of these big player that is still courage enough to say that they are doing waterfall? I haven&rsquo;t seen these dinosaurs lately.&nbsp;So using the agile approach is a common sense, but is it really so common with these Big players? How they had embraced it? I don&rsquo;t have much to report here.&nbsp;Last 3 years I&rsquo;ve been very deeply involved as coach and trainer in Agile transition program at Skype. Global and fairly big organization been transformed from project focused organization to the product organization with 60 at the beginning and later around 140 component-based products, from more than 1,5 year product release cycle to 1 month release cycle. And I have to report that it was a pain&hellip; Pain of Birth!&nbsp;In this session you will not learn how to escape the pain of agile birth (if you are pregnant with the idea), but you can learn simple and common sense things that can surprise you unpleasantly if you have never heard about them. We will go through the mistakes we did, but also what helped us to win some (important, Enterprise wide) agile battles and to deliver great products. And we will have Q&amp;A session to cover questions important to you.&nbsp;As a result you will be trained when to breathe and stay relaxed until your organization is really ready and all have to push to deliver proper Enterprise Agile.</p>
