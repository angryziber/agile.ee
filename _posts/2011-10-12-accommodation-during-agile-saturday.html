<p>For the period of 28.-30.10.2011 Sokos Hotel Viru has offered the participants of Agile Saturday the following special room rates: Standard SGL 57 EUR &#47; DBL 67 EUR. In case you wish to stay there with the offered price, give the administrator the password, which is (surprise-surprise): <em>Agile Saturday<&#47;em>.</p>
<p>Hotel Viru is situated at the very heart of Tallinn and during the Soviet era it used to be a kind of a gate to the western world. It was the first really modern hotel in Tallinn, where all the important guests and celebrities stayed. Also it is well known that many of the rooms were under constant attention of the "investigatory organs". For more information and historical facts you can visit the&nbsp;KGB museum at the hotel.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the hotel's webpage: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sokoshotels.fi&#47;en&#47;hotels&#47;tallinn&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.sokoshotels.fi&#47;en&#47;hotels&#47;tallinn&#47;<&#47;a>. Sokos Hotel Viru, Viru v&auml;ljak 4, 10111 Tallinn, Estonia. Ph. +372 6 809 308.</p>
<p>See you in Tallinn!</p>
