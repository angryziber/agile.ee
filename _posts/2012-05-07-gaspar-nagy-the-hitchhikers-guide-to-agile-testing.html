<p>Closing keynote speaker confirmed for <a title="Agile Saturday VII" href="http://agile.ee/agile-saturday/agile-saturday-vii/">Agile Saturday VII</a>!</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Waterfallica suggests that testing should be performed after the implementation completely finished. It also suggests that developers should not know the tests to be used for verification in advance at all, otherwise they would build an application that fulfills only the given test cases.</p>
<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Agile Testing gives a new emphasis to testing: it contains more practical, so called agile ideas. This guide is becoming more and more popular among developers and testers nowadays. Why? First, it is slightly more exciting; and &ldquo;secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover&rdquo;.</p>
