<p>I stumbled upon a blog of Dave Thomas, a signer of the Agile Manifestor, where he very reasonably complains about the misuse of the word "agile" and misuse of the whole concept.</p>
<p>According to him, here is what it is all about:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>What to do:<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Find out where you are<br />
Take a small step towards your goal<br />
Adjust your understanding based on what you learned<br />
Repeat</p>
<p><strong>How to do it:<&#47;strong></p>
<p>When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>A good read:<br />
