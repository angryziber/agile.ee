<h2><img class="alignleft" title="Marko" src="http:&#47;&#47;agile.ee&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;01&#47;makro_alas.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="259" &#47;>Test Driven Development: An Essential Practice To Go Fast<&#47;h2><br />
Test Driven Development is a software development process that relies on short cycles of writing test code and making the tests pass by writing production code. I will give an overview of TDD and talk about my own experience using TDD.</p>
<p>We will talk about the reasons why development teams slow down over time, and how that process can be prevented by a comprehensive suite of tests. We will discuss the three laws of Test Driven Development - the central discipline of TDD, and the benefits of following these rules: increased quality, reliable low level documentation, decoupled design, and no fear of change.</p>
