<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Effective testing is an integrated part of agile development. It's essential for a successful team to be able to combine different agile testing practices to generate a cycle of feedback and constant improvement.&nbsp;Finding the right balance between the amount of information gained by testing, the effort/cost of testing and the feedback time is crucial. It becomes easier when testing is a cross-functional activity engaging all team members.</span></div></p>

<p>In this presentation we will walk through the different testing activities required in order to develop and complete a feature from specification to Done. The presentation focuses on higher level testing activities that typically can be performed by all team members. The goal is to provide an easy and practical approach to understanding the idea, potential and even some of the pitfalls of the presented agile testing practices.</p>
