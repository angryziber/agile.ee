<h2>Real Options - Introducing Staff Liquidity<img class="alignright" title="Chris Matts" src="http://evolvebeyond.com/images/headshots/large/chris.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="252" /></h2><br />
The key to making decisions is not how or what or why. The key to making decisions is WHEN to make them. Chris Matts will introduce Real Options, a decision making process based on financial maths and applied psychology. Now we know how to make decisions, Chris will show you how to make the right decision, especially when people don't want you to.</p>
<p>We introduce staff liquidity, or how to make the most out of your team. It turns out that real options is something you always do when you manage staff liquidity in the right way. You will never think about management in the same way again.</p>
