<h2>We have decided to become agile. What should we do next?</h2><br />
<img class="alignleft" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTPsm2JgXG6DYAOxiUTSBraSzTCu-FCO0LorKYn0aIWqBaRHlYo_Q" alt="" width="183" height="275" />This is a question I hear quite often but it is impossible to pull out<br />
a ToDo list with descriptions of steps that transforms your team into<br />
an agile one. Instead of answer a number of questions arise - who is<br />
this "we"? why it was decided to become agile? what do you know about<br />
agile or what you think you know about agile? how you define "agile"?<br />
It means that before any possible answer to a question what to do next<br />
or advise how to continue we should have common understanding of what<br />
agile is and means.</p>
<p>This session is targeting beginners. We speak about and discuss the<br />
reasons what drives people and teams toward agile methodologies, what<br />
should you think about before making decision about using (or not<br />
using) agile methodology and what are the prerequisites of success<br />
while adopting agile methodology.</p>
