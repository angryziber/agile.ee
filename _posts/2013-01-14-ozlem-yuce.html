Maersk Line IT spends over $100m p.a. on development, over 20 development teams spread around the world with a mix of onshore/offshore and thin outsourcing. The Wrath of Waterfall: Historical view of how we worked<br />
First Contact: A giant project (X-Leap) &ndash; &shy;what we learned. what worked, what didn&rsquo;t<br />
