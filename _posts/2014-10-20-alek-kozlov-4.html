<h2>Introduction to SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) &ndash; Good, Bad, Ugly<a href="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Alek_220.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-923" alt="Alek" src="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Alek_220.jpg" width="220" height="220" /></a></h2><br />
You can find in the Internet a lot of voices raving against this approach, as a try to commercialize Agile.</p>
<p>On the other side a lot of big companies are very into this model and they find it very helpful in understanding how one Agile Company should be structured.</p>
<p>I have reviewed SAFe model and in my session I will share pluses and minuses that I have found in it. Overall I satisfied with they way how Dean Leffingwell been systemized the ""How"" one enterprise can work in agile setting. I have some smaller concerns to share with you and, in my humble opinion, one big architectural flaw that should be changed/addressed.</p>
<p>Come and discuss these topics with me and take away understanding about how does this model can be used in your settings.</p>
