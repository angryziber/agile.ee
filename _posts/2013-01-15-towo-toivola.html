<h2>A balanced metrics set for a software business<img class="alignright" title="Towo" src="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_17891.jpg" alt="" width="190" /></h2><br />
"There are so many things that we can measure about a software business that there is a temptation to measure too much. There is always also the temptation to link pay to performance and set targets for metrics results. Some things are so easy to measure, but others so difficult. Does it make sense to measure estimates that are not facts?<br />
Towo will describe a metrics set suitable for leaders of software business to gain situational awareness. He will also touch on the nature of measuring work and incentives."</p>
