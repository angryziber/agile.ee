<p>Creativity is an inseparable part of innovation. Companies that induce creativity tend to be much more successful than their "non-creative" counterparts. There are many methodologies to help you a lot in creating and environment to support creativity. But many oraganizations still fail miserably. I think a big reason for that is how people communicate with eachother. And by that make the awesome systems created to be not used</p>
