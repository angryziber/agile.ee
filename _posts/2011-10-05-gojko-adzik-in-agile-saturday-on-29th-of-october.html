<p>Gojko (Author of the book Specification by Example)<strong></strong>got bitten by the specification-by-example bug five years ago. Since then, he has helped numerous teams implement these practices. In October he is visiting Tallinn on the request of <a href="http://www.devtraining.ee" target="_blank">Devtraining</a> where he also gives a class on the topic of <a href="http://www.devtraining.ee/agile-acceptance-testing-and-specification-example" target="_blank"><em>From User Stories to Acceptance Tests.</em> </a></p>
