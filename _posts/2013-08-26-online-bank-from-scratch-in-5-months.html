The same article is also <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.codeborne.com&#47;2012&#47;12&#47;5.html">available in Russian<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Of course, great deal of this success is because of the Agile methods that were applied right from the beginning, both managerial and technical. The second part is, of course, the people. From both sides: developers and customer's representatives.</p>
<p>During the upcoming Agile Saturday I am going to share some "secrets" of how it was possible, especially in Russia. For now, read the blog post and have your questions ready!</p>
