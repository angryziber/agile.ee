<h2>Beyond Value Streams: Experimental Evolution in Action<img class="alignright" title="Claudio" src="http://agilesensei.com/bio/Claudio%20Perrone.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="259" /></h2><br />
In their desperate search for a viable business model, Lean Startup entrepreneurs treat "learning" as a true measure of progress, well above the number of features they develop or even the amount of customers they initially acquire.In their path to continuous improvement, skilled A3 thinkers treat "learning" as a primary value too, well above the problems they try to solve.As a change management approach, the Kanban Method creates the conditions for many learning opportunities as well. It specifically encourages to "Improve Collaboratively and Evolve Experimentally", a practice also fully embraced by what is now known as "Lean Change".<br />
In this session, Claudio will share stories, workflows and practical thinking tools that illustrate how the act of deliberately capturing and evolving "learning streams" (as opposed to - or rather in addition to - the more conventional value streams) can lead to surprising consequences.</p>
