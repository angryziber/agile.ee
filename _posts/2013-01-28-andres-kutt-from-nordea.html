<h2>How agile works and how to prove it<&#47;h2><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;agile.ee&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;01&#47;Andres-Kytt.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-601" title="Andres Kytt" src="http:&#47;&#47;agile.ee&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;01&#47;Andres-Kytt.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="126" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>We all know that agile works. We would not be here otherwise. But do we know why? And to what extent? Does it matter? To answer these questions, I'll firstly give a brief overview of the theory behind agile methods. Then I'll take that theory, mix it with some math and pour into certain tools in order to quantify exactly how much is agile worth. There will be graphs, coconuts and baths involved. And reasonably little math</p>
