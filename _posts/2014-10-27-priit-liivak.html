<h2>Code DOJO<&#47;h2><br />
<b>What is it?<&#47;b></p>
<p>Dojo is the Japanese term for &ldquo;place of the way&rdquo;, but it mostly describes a training place for<br />
martial arts. For us, it is a training place to learn more about writing good quality code and<br />
gaining tremendously valuable insights into the way other people solve problems.</p>
<p><b>Who is invited?<&#47;b></p>
<p>Code Dojo is open to everyone. Regardless of your skill level or your job description in<br />
Outlook email signature, you are welcome. This includes junior testers, senior architects,<br />
project managers, analysts, lead programmers so well versed in their craft that the only<br />
challenge they have in their daily work is the tough decision which flavor of syrup to add<br />
to their coffee on this particular morning, programmers yet to discover the joys of Extract<br />
Method refactoring shortcut key and you. Especially you!</p>
<p><b>Why do it?<&#47;b></p>
<p>To become better, practice you must! Two hours in a Code Dojo will teach you far more than<br />
a month grinding out one Model-View-Controller after another. Solving seemingly simple<br />
problems in different ways and under different restrictions will challenge your mind, seeing<br />
how other people steer their solutions to glorious victory through the rocky Red-Green-<br />
Refactor cycles will broaden your own approach and improve your skills. You are guaranteed<br />
to walk away with multiple invaluable insights.</p>
<p><b>How do we practice?<&#47;b></p>
<p>We will solve a kata, a simple programming challenge using Test-Driven Development<br />
methods. You are free to come and practice alone. I strongly encourage you to bring a friend<br />
or find a partner in the Dojo and work on the kata together as a pair. To make things even<br />
more fun, we also try randori, free-style practice where multiple people line up to solve the<br />
kata on a single computer. The first person writes a failing test, the second person makes the<br />
failing test pass and then writes the next failing test before passing the turn to next person in<br />
line.</p>
<p><strong>I have never used Test-Driven Development. Can I still participate?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Yes! You should definitely come. If you are not familiar with TDD, you can try solve the kata<br />
without it, but be warned, you will be missing out on a lot of fun. I recommend pairing up<br />
with someone or taking a turn in the randori line when you think you have gotten the gist of<br />
it. Test-Driven Development methods used in Code Dojo are very easy to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Which programming languages do I have to use?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>You can use any programming language you are familiar with. Unit testing frameworks exist<br />
for most languages (Java = JUnit, C# = NUnit, JavaScript = Jasmine, Scala = ScalaTest, Ruby<br />
= Test::Unit, etc.) and for nearly all of them IDE support is available. So you can write your<br />
tests in your favourite programming language (or the one you want to practise) and run them<br />
in your favorite development environment.</p>
