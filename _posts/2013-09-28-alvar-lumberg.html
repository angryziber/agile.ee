<h2>20 developers, 3 countries, 1 service - a case study</h2><br />
<img class="alignleft" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR59Qo8UGx_VhZnXx41d9dH5Wt1_WAUQ5ughvrs4mL975ZnG6nfcw" alt="" width="160" height="160" />TransferWise is a global foreign payments company that is moving 1M GBP a day. Our dev team went 3 to 20 in the past year, we span 3 locations, experiment a lot and are anxious to get things done. This puts pressure on efficient communication and strong practices.</p>
<p>This talk is a case study of the problems we have been facing and what have been our learnings. You should come if you've struggled with distributed teams, nurturing culture and/or fast-growing teams and have a nice chat with similar minds.</p>
