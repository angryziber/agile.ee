You are an expert in TDD & Pair Programming, hold a Scrum Master certificate and know the Agile Manifesto from heart? Then this talk is probably too basic for you! Everyone else in invited to jump head-first into a journey through space, learning about many core agile methods and concepts on the way, like: Iterations, User Stories, Planning Poker, Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Integration and more! Our journey will end on Mars where we will use SCRUM to conceive, build and continually improve the first Mars Station of mankind! Well, at least sort off..</p>
