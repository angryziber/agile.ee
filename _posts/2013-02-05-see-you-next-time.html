<p>Agile Saturday VIII is over and was the biggest event so far.</p>
<p>Big thanks to all the speakers, organizers and the attendees!</p>
<p>We are already thinking about organizing a next event, but this time we would benefit from some help.</p>
<p><strong>WANTED<&#47;strong>: Volunteers, Track hosts and Speakers!</p>
<p>Please let us know if you would like to either help with the small things during the event, ready to keep track of some track (and at one point we had as many as 6 last time!) or have an experience to share with the community.</p>
<p>And, last but not least, let us know if <strong>you could sponsor<&#47;strong> our future events. Venue, coffee, prizes, etc are not cheap, but we would like to keep the event free of charge!</p>
<p>Together we can make it even better, keep in touch!</p>
