<h2>LiquidO - No management from the trenches</h2><br />
You might have heard of a new breed of organisational models, responding to the fast growing adaptability, engagement and collaboration needs within modern company structures.&nbsp;Or you might have simply experienced the sound problems of slowness, rigidity, bureaucracy, disengagement along with various kinds of waste and bottlenecks that &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; organisational models generate and suffer nowadays.</p>
<h3>Bio</h3><br />
