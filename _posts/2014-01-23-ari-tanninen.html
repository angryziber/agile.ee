<h2>Design up front is back!<&#47;h2><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;agile.ee&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;01&#47;ari-tanninen.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-810" title="ari tanninen" src="http:&#47;&#47;agile.ee&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;01&#47;ari-tanninen.png" alt="" width="216" height="216" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Working software is an expensive way of getting user feedback when compared with role-play or design prototypes.</p>
<p>I will present practical examples from the domain of participatory and user-centered design in the context of product and service development. These include various kinds of prototypes, role-play, design games, and simulations.</p>
<p>The advantages of these methods include super-fast iterations, committed stakeholders, and ultimately better systems and cheaper IT acquisitions.</p>
