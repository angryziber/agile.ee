<h2>If you are serious about continuous improvement aim for a Single DoD<a href="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/luis.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-665" title="Luis Goncalves" src="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/luis.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="280" /></a></h2><br />
Your developers tell you: &ldquo;My job is done!&rdquo;, but we cannot release it to customers, or every component works great and passes all tests, but when we test the full product as a whole we find huge amount of problems. Do you have an organization where you have several DoDs(Definition of Done), for example for User Stories, Features and Epics? Have you ever heard people in your organisation saying they are waiting for other people to finish their job? Have they ever failed to deliver because of this? Does all of this sound familiar to you? I would like to discuss how important it is for a company to aim for a single DoD. Having a single DoD makes us to think about all tasks that are needed in order to release the product to our customers without entering a waterfall mode. I see many companies with different levels of&nbsp; DoD; this makes companies slower and not serious about continuous improvement. In my presentation, I want to explain how a company gets slower when they choose the path of having several DoDs. In order to help companies to solve this issue, I will to present an improvement roadmap that companies can follow and achieve a single DoD for all work. This will help you deliver software faster and with less effort. Join us to learn from our failures as well as our successes! Learn how you may increase the throughput of your team and achieve more with the same people.</p>
