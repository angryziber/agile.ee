<p>After soaking in the Waterfall, got tortured by the Scrum You, queued by the KangBang and then stopped to Lean on something - the process is still not perfect! Here you shall hear the saga of team Artify, last three-year experiences with different startups, finding & creating value for customers and building the team. If not useful, then definitely memorable :D!</p>
