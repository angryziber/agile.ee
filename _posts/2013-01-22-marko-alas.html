"Test Driven Development is a software development process that relies on short cycles of writing test code and making the tests pass by writing production code. I will give an overview of TDD and talk about my own experience using TDD.</p>
<p>We will talk about the reasons code quality decreases over time, and how that process can be prevented by a comprehensive suite of tests. We will discuss the three laws of Test Driven Development - the central discipline of TDD, and the benefits of following these rules: increased quality, reliable low level documentation, decoupled design, and no fear of change."</p>
