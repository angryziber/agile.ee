<h2>Extend HTML, CSS and JS with AngularJS</h2><br />
Slow application reload makes for lagging frontend development. JSF rendering is clunky<a href="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Samuli.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-706" title="Samuli" src="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Samuli.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="198" /></a> and no one wants to maintain the code. On the other hand pure HTML/JS/CSS written in a maintainable way is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>We need a MV* (Model View Whatever) that is testable and plays well with others. We filtered TodoMVC MV* frameworks down to two, and put them head to head.</p>
<p>AngularJS prevailed one sprint later. On the way, we ran into some pretty fabulous tooling and created some of our own. I'll share best practices on how to extend the big three (HTML/CSS/JS) with AngularJS. Take a step towards frontend superheroism and maybe avoid stepping on your cape like we did.</p>
