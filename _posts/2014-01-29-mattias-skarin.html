<h2><img class="alignright" title="Mattias" src="http://www.crisp.se/uti/timthumb.php?src=/wp-content/Cimy_User_Extra_Fields/mattias-skarin/patrik-mattias-s-halv.jpg&amp;w=200" alt="" width="200" height="287" />Improving the full value chain</h2><br />
Making products fly involves more than just the development team. So how do we involve, intract and improve with the non software parts of the value chain? Let me walk through lean techniques and thinking that helps drive improvements across organizational borders. I&rsquo;ll share experiences and examples from real case studies where they have been put to use.</p>
<p>Bio:<br />
Sun Tzu once said the ultimate responsibility of generalship is maneuver into a position of success.<br />
How do we do this in software? This is my quest.<br />
I work as a Lean and Kanban coach, growing people and systems to create great products - while having more fun doing it.<br />
I&rsquo;m an author of the book &rdquo;Kanban and Scrum, making the most of both&rdquo; and regularly train and coach in Lean, Kanban and TDD.<br />
