<p>Imagine this - Your startup at launch got a handful of users who are &rdquo;innovators&rdquo;.<a href="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Alek_220.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-923" title="Alek" src="http://agile.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Alek_220.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="220" /></a> You are moving further and saw that the users you are dealing with now are &ldquo;early visionaries&rdquo;. Later, after you with ease jumped over the chasm, you found yourself living and talking with &ldquo;early majority&rdquo;. And again, one small jump and you are pleasantly in the midst of &ldquo;late majority&rdquo;. One nice transition and even &ldquo;laggards&rdquo; becoming your good friends. Every one loves you - you are famous, rich and respected. Plea of "Airport's business books" - to never give in in dreaming of building a great company and product - worked for you well! Very nice and happy story.</p>
<p>But life full of things that you don&rsquo;t want to hear and my late experience forced me to agree with Steve Blank who was saying - &ldquo;most startups [Alek: companies] fail because they didn't develop their market [Alek: customers], not because the didn't develop their product&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I will share some of my observations of a common pitfalls of untested assumptions and the blisses of work with the tested hypotheses and validated knowledge. Value of this session is heard story that is &ldquo;easy to retell&rdquo; and will covered practical tools critical for success and useful for organisation of any size - startup or enterprise.</p>
