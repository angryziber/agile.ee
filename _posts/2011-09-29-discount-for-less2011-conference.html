<p>LESS is a network of individuals that regularly organizes conferences about Lean and Agile Product Development. This year LESS2011 has a clear focus on<br />
management innovation and organization transformation.<br />
The Keynotes include Lean specialists Peter Middleton and Jams Sutton as well as<br />
radical management proponent Steven Denning and a representative of the most<br />
promising approach to budgeting and strategy: Bjarte Bogsnes.</p>
<p>The LESS team wants to encourage all local communities to participate by<br />
offering a special discount code. Agile Estonia members will get a 100Eur<br />
discount on the price of registration if they register with the<br />
AGILEESTONIACOMMUNITY discount code: http://less2011.leanssc.org/register/</p>
<p>See you in Stockholm!</p>
