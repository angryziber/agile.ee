<p>Agile Estonia board has agreed to give one-year membership to all registered attendees of <a title="Agile Saturday" href="http://agile.ee/agile-saturday/">Agile Saturday</a> events. Members are expected to participate in the discussions on mailing lists as well on <a title="Agile Dinner" href="http://agile.ee/agile-dinner/">Agile Dinner</a> and other events.</p>
<p>Currently, we don't have membership fees, but members are expected to share their knowledge and help with some organizational aspects.</p>
<p>TODO: where to subscribe to mailing lists.</p>
<p>Also, follow our tweets and facebook posts!</p>
